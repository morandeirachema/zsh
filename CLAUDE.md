# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What this is

A personal **zsh dotfiles** repo, cloned onto multiple Linux machines. There is no build, no test
runner, and no application code — the "product" is shell configuration applied via symlinks. The stack
is zinit (plugins) + starship (prompt) + fzf + zoxide + eza/bat.

## Commands

```bash
./install.sh                 # apply config on this machine (idempotent — safe to re-run)
./install.sh --minimal       # zsh + plugins + prompt only; skips eza/bat + Nerd Font
./install.sh --no-font       # skip the Nerd Font download
./install.sh --no-chsh       # don't change the default login shell
exec zsh                     # reload the shell after editing config

# Validate before committing (there are no unit tests — syntax-check instead):
zsh  -n zsh/.zshrc
zsh  -n zsh/aliases.zsh
bash -n install.sh
python3 -c "import tomllib; tomllib.load(open('starship/starship.toml','rb'))"   # TOML parses
```

Do **not** run bare `starship config` to validate the prompt — it opens `$EDITOR` and hangs a
non-interactive session. Use the `tomllib` check above, or `starship print-config`.

## How it fits together (the important part)

**Symlink model.** `install.sh` symlinks repo files into `$HOME`, it does not copy them:
- `zsh/.zshrc` → `~/.zshrc`
- `starship/starship.toml` → `~/.config/starship.toml`

Consequence: **after `install.sh` has run once, editing a file in this repo edits the live shell.**
There is no rebuild step — just `exec zsh`. When applying, install.sh moves any pre-existing real
`~/.zshrc` to `~/.zshrc.pre-console.<timestamp>` before linking.

**Self-location.** `zsh/.zshrc` finds its own repo directory at runtime with
`ZDOTREPO="${${(%):-%x}:A:h}"` (resolves the symlink) and sources `aliases.zsh` from there. Because of
this, **`aliases.zsh` must stay in `zsh/` next to `.zshrc`** — moving it breaks the source path.

**Plugins load via zinit TURBO mode (async).** zinit bootstraps by cloning itself into
`~/.local/share/zinit` on first launch, then plugins load *after* the first prompt via
`zinit wait lucid` — startup is instant, but autosuggestions/highlighting activate a few ms
in. Consequences that must be preserved when editing the plugin block:
- `compinit` runs **once**, inside the first turbo wave's `atinit` (`zicompinit; zicdreplay`).
  Do **not** add a synchronous `compinit`/`zinit cdreplay` too, or it runs twice.
- A keybinding for an async plugin (e.g. history-substring-search's Up/Down/Ctrl-P/N) must be
  set in that plugin's `atload` hook — the widget does not exist until the async load finishes.
  Binding it at top level silently no-ops.
- `fzf-tab` sits in the second wave so it loads after compinit and after the widget-wrapping
  plugins (fast-syntax-highlighting, autosuggestions), per its load-order requirement.

**Graceful degradation is a hard rule.** Every external tool in `.zshrc` and `aliases.zsh` is guarded
with `command -v <tool>` so a fresh box with nothing installed still starts. Keep this pattern for any
new tool. Note `bat` is installed as `batcat` on Debian/Ubuntu — `aliases.zsh` already handles both names.

**Machine-specific config never goes in the repo.** Local paths, secrets, and per-host aliases belong
in `~/.zshrc.local`, which `.zshrc` sources last and `.gitignore` excludes. Don't hardcode host-specific
values into the tracked files.

**install.sh portability.** It detects the package manager (**brew** on macOS, else apt/dnf/pacman/zypper)
via a `pkg_install` wrapper and installs user-local where possible (starship and zoxide into `~/.local/bin`
on Linux, or via brew on macOS). `SUDO` is empty for brew (Homebrew must not run under sudo). New
dependencies should route through `pkg_install` with a graceful `warn` fallback rather than assuming apt.
macOS specifics already handled: font via `--cask font-jetbrains-mono-nerd-font`, neovim via brew (the
`install_neovim_release` Linux-tarball fallback is Linux-only), no `gcc/make` (Xcode CLT provides `cc`),
and the chsh step is skipped when the login shell is already any `*/zsh` (so brew-zsh doesn't fight
system-zsh). Debian's `fdfind`/`batcat` binary names are handled in `aliases.zsh`; brew ships real
`fd`/`bat`, so both paths work.
Two tools that are often absent from distro repos (lazygit, neovim) have `install_*_release` helpers that
fetch the right arch tarball from GitHub into `~/.local/bin` — follow that pattern for similar tools.

**Neovim / LazyVim is vendored, not cloned per machine.** `nvim/` holds the LazyVim *starter* (init.lua +
`lua/config/*` + `lua/plugins/*`); `install.sh` symlinks the whole dir to `~/.config/nvim`. The LazyVim
framework itself and all plugins are pulled from the internet by lazy.nvim on the first `nvim` launch — so
`nvim/` stays tiny. When it runs, lazy.nvim writes `lazy-lock.json` into `~/.config/nvim` (= into this repo,
via the symlink); commit it to pin identical plugin versions across machines. Editor extras go in
`nvim/lua/plugins/`. The whole nvim step is gated behind `--no-nvim` (and skipped by `--minimal`) so a
machine with its own nvim config isn't clobbered. `lazygit/config.yml` is symlinked as a single file (not the
whole dir) so lazygit's runtime `state.yml` stays local and out of the repo.

## Conventions

- Keep shell startup fast: no network calls at startup beyond zinit's one-time self-clone, and never
  link a remote webfont.
- `install.sh` adds one `include.path` entry to `~/.gitconfig` pointing at `git/delta.gitconfig` — the
  **only** state it changes outside `$HOME` dotfile symlinks. It is additive/revertible on purpose (do NOT
  switch back to writing individual global keys — that clobbers an admin's existing pager). The include is
  added only if not already present, so re-runs stay idempotent.
- **Production/security posture (see `ROADMAP.md`).** This is used on servers and privileged boxes, so keep
  these invariants when editing: `compinit` runs with `-i` (never `-C` — `-C` skips the insecure-fpath
  check); `~/.zshrc.local` is sourced only when `-O` (owned by the user); prefer `pkg_install` over
  `curl | sh` (piped installers are a labelled fallback only); the prompt's `username`/`hostname` (SSH/root)
  and `kubernetes`/`aws` segments are safety features — don't remove them. `--server` skips the font on
  headless hosts.
- Commits use no Claude author/co-author references.
