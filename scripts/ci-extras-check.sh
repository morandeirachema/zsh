# CI helper — assert the non-minimal "extras" installed correctly.
# Run inside a distro container from the repo root, AFTER:
#     ./install.sh --no-nvim --no-font --no-chsh -y
# Usage: scripts/ci-extras-check.sh <distro-name>
#
# NOT `set -e`: we tally every check and report them all, then exit non-zero if
# any hard check failed. fabric is a soft check (its install fetches a GitHub
# release, so a network / API-rate-limit miss must not fail the build).
